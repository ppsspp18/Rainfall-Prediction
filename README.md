Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM) to predict rainfall on the Australian weather dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package.
Preprocessed data with one-hot encoding and missing value handling, and visualized performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) using Python tools like Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
